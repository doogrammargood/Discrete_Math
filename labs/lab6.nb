We need to explain what we mean by shuffling a deck of cards. We mean that \
you perform the following procedure: 1.) Split the deck into two (not \
necessarily equal) pieces. 2.) Interleave those two pieces. For example, if \
our deck consists of 5 cards, initially ordered as {1,2,3,4,5}, then after \
splitting we may get two piles, {1,2,3}, {4,5} which, after interleaving, can \
look like {4,1,2,3,5}. The only requirement that the cards in each pile are \
still in the same order relative to each other after interleaving. Note that \
{1,2,3,4,5} is a valid shuffle. Finally, we are only interested in the final \
ordering of the cards. You can get the same ordering {1,2,3,4,5} by using the \
split {1,2,3},{4,5} or by using the split {1,2}{3,4,5}. We consider these to \
be the same. I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m getting this definition from the popular \
book \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Shape\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] by Jordan Ellenberg.

Our problem is \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]How many ways can you shuffle a 52-card \
deck?\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

To attack the problem, let S(n) be the number of ways to shuffle a deck of n \
cards.\

The first step to solve a problem like this is to write out many small \
examples by hand. This is possible because our problem is easily \
parameterized by the size of the deck, n. Generally, if you have a \
complicated problem, it helps to find simpler cases.

To list out the possibilities by hand, it helps to be organized. This helps \
to ensure that we don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t miscount. To help organize the \
counting, we parameterize the shuffles by the sizes of the piles in the \
splitting step. This is indicated by the |\[CloseCurlyQuote]s.

S(1) = 1 (The shuffles are: {1})
S(2) = 2 (The shuffles are: {1,2}, | {2,1})
S(3) = 5 (The shuffles are: {1,2,3}, | {1,3,2}, {3,1,2}, | {2,1,3}, {2,3,1})
S(4) = 12 (The shuffles are: {1,2,3,4}, | {1,2,4,3}, {1,4,2,3}, {4,1,2,3}, | \
{1,3,4,2}, {1,3,2,4}, {3,1,2,4}, {3,1,4,2}, {3,4,1,2} | {2,1,3,4}, {2,3,1,4}, \
{2,3,4,1})
S(5) = 27 (The shuffles are: {1,2,3,4,5}, | {1,2,3,5,4}, {1,2,5,3,4}, \
{1,5,2,3,4}, {5,1,2,3,4}, | {1,2,4,3,5}, {1,4,2,3,5}, {4,1,2,3,5}, \
{1,2,4,5,3}, {1,4,2,5,3}, {4,1,2,5,3}, {1,4,5,2,3}, {4,1,5,2,3}, {4,5,1,2,3}, \
| {1,3,2,4,5}, {3,1,2,4,5}, {1,3,4,2,5}, {3,1,4,2,5}, {3,4,1,2,5}, \
{1,3,4,5,2}, {3,1,4,5,2}, {3,4,1,5,2}, {3,4,5,1,2} | {2,1,3,4,5}, \
{2,3,1,4,5}, {2,3,4,1,5}, {2,3,4,5,1})

Listing these possibilities by hand is tedious. It\[CloseCurlyQuote]s easy to \
make mistakes. On the other hand, sometimes we notice interesting patterns in \
the process of listing the items. We could continue and try to calculate S(6) \
by hand.\

It was very tedious to list even the first 5 terms of our sequence. Where \
tedium obstructs, Mathematica triumphs. Here, we show how we can list the \
first several terms programmatically using the powerful Map/Filter/Reduce \
paradigm. Map/Filter/Reduce is a collection of techniques used to manipulate \
lists. Many useful functions can be found here: \
https://reference.wolfram.com/language/guide/ListManipulation.html.

One (inefficient) way to solve this problem is to consider every possible \
permutation (arrangement) of the cards and count only those that are valid \
shuffles. We can use the built-in function Permutations to get all of the \
permutations of the cards. We will need to write a function isValid to \
determine if a permutation is a valid shuffle according to our definition. \
Then we can Select only those permutations that are valid and count them with \
the Length function.

To check if a permutation is valid, we use the powerful function FoldList \
(The documentation is more clear than I can be: \
https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/FoldList.html ) that plays the \
role of a loop in the Map/Filter/Reduce paradigm. The procedure is to step \
through each card and add it to one of several piles. We add a card to a pile \
if it is the next largest number. If the next card doesn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t \
belong on top of any pile, then start a new pile with it.  At the end of the \
procedure, we will have a list of piles. If there are 2 or 1 piles, then our \
permutation is a valid shuffle. 

The function FoldList takes three arguments: a function to apply repeatedly \
(Moving a card to a pile), a starting value (0 piles to start), and a list of \
values (the cards in the deck). FoldList returns a list of applications of \
the function. The last element in the output list will be the piles of cards \
after the entire deck has been processed.

The Mathematica code below implements this idea.\

There is a better way to list the valid shuffles. Imagine that we have \
already split the deck into two piles, a Left pile of smaller cards and a \
Right pile of larger cards, but we don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t know how many cards \
are in each pile. Then we create the shuffled deck by choosing cards from \
each pile one-at-a-time and labeling them \
\[OpenCurlyQuote]L\[CloseCurlyQuote] (for Left) and \[OpenCurlyQuote]R\
\[CloseCurlyQuote] for right. The shuffled deck that we produce can be \
associated with a string of L\[CloseCurlyQuote]s and R\[CloseCurlyQuote]s. We \
can then convert the string of L\[CloseCurlyQuote]s and R\[CloseCurlyQuote]s \
unambiguously into numbers by first numbering each of the \
L\[CloseCurlyQuote]s from left to right in sequence, then labeling each of \
the R\[CloseCurlyQuote]s from left to right in sequence.

For example, the sequence R,L,L,R,L,R represents a sequence that can be \
decoded as R,L,L,R,L,R -> R,1,2,R,3,R -> 4,1,2,5,3,6.

There are 2^n sequences of {R,L}, since each of the n symbols can be either \
of 2 choices. This would seem to suggest that there are 2^n possible \
shuffles, which contradicts the OEIS entry. The issue is that multiple \
sequences of {R,L} map to the same sequence of numbers. For example, LLRRR \
and LLLLR both map to the sequence 1,2,3,4,5. In fact, this sequence is \
represented 6 times when it should only be represented once. Also, this \
fully-sorted sequence is the only sequence that has multiple representations \
as a sequence of {R,L}. This explains why the correct formula is 2^n-n. (But \
this explanation is detailed enough to qualify as a proof.)

The explanation also gives a better algorithm to generate the sequence S(n).\

(15 points ) Suppose that we want to shuffle a deck of 52 cards. We perform a \
shuffle that is the same as the valid shuffles described earlier, except that \
we split the deck into 3 instead of 2 piles before interleaving. How many \
ways can this occur?

Steps:
1.) Modify the Mathematica Code to generate the first 8 examples.
2.) Enter these numbers into OEIS. There is only 1 matching entry.
3.) Find the Mathematica code in this entry.
4.) Modify that Mathematica code to tell you the 52nd number in the series.\
