Notes on installing and activating Mathematica.

Here are the steps to install and activate:
1.) Download mathematica from https://software.tulane.edu/
2.) Follow the installation guide: https://reference.wolfram.com/language/tutorial/InstallingMathematica.html
3.) Run mathematica. Note: On linux machines, the command to do this is "WolframNB".
4.) Activate mathematica. There should be prompts in the GUI. Do not use SSO (Single Sign On). Instead, get an activation code using this link: https://www.wolfram.com/siteinfo/

Mathematica's troubleshooting and customer service is very good, but are only available 8am-5pm Monday-Friday. https://www.wolfram.com/support/contact/?source=nav
